# displaylif

This is meant to be used along with 'readlif' which can be found here[readlif](https://pypi.org/project/readlif/)

Currently this has only been tested on LIF files with single images and many frames. If the LIF file does not have metadata the display might not be as accurate.

The `displaylif` package display package for Leica Image Format (LIF) files. 

Python 3.9 or above is required.

## Roadmap

- [Done] Display all the frames for one image.
- [Planned] Improved Documentation.
- [Planned] Allow for multiple image layering.
- [Planned] Allow for easy color analysis of LIF files.
- [Planned] Allow for deletion after analysis and display.
